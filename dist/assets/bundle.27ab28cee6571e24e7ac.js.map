Useful for responsive design.

Defaults to `(element) => element.clientHeight`\n\t * @param {function} [options.getWidth]  A function that is passed an element and returns element\n\t * width, where element is the wrapper div. Defaults to `(element) => element.clientWidth`\n\t * @param {object} [options.containerStyle] A style object for the `<div>` that will wrap your component.\n\t * The dimensions of this `div` are what are passed as props to your component. The default style is\n\t * `{ width: '100%', height: '100%', padding: 0, border: 0 }` which will cause the `div` to fill its\n\t * parent in most cases. If you are using a flexbox layout you will want to change this default style.\n\t * @param {string} [options.className] Control the class name set on the wrapper `<div>`\n\t * @param {boolean} [options.elementResize=false] Set true to watch the wrapper `div` for changes in\n\t * size which are not a result of window resizing - e.g. changes to the flexbox and other layout.\n\t * @return {function}                   A higher-order component that can be\n\t * used to enhance a react component `Dimensions()(MyComponent)`\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t * // ES2015\n\t * import React from

Useful for responsive design. Properties update on\n * window resize. **Note** that the parent element must have either a\n * height or a width, or nothing will be rendered\n *\n * Can be used as a\n * [higher-order component](http://babeljs.io/blog/2015/06/07/react-on-es6-plus/#property-initializers)\n * or as an [ES7 class decorator](https://github.com/wycats/javascript-decorators)\n * (see examples)\n *\n * @param {object} [options]\n * @param {function} [options.getHeight] A function that is passed an element and returns element\n * height, where element is the wrapper div. Defaults to `(element) => element.clientHeight`\n * @param {function} [options.getWidth]  A function that is passed an element and returns element\n * width, where element is the wrapper div. Defaults to `(element) => element.clientWidth`\n * @param {object} [options.containerStyle] A style object for the `<div>` that will wrap your component.\n * The dimensions of this `div` are what are passed as props to your component. The default style is\n * `{ width: '100%', height: '100%', padding: 0, border: 0 }` which will cause the `div` to fill its\n * parent in most cases. If you are using a flexbox layout you will want to change this default style.\n * @param {string} [options.className] Control the class name set on the wrapper `<div>`\n * @param {boolean} [options.elementResize=false] Set true to watch the wrapper `div` for changes in\n * size which are not a result of window resizing - e.g. changes to the flexbox and other layout.\n * @return {function}                   A higher-order component that can be\n * used to enhance a react component `Dimensions()(MyComponent)`\n *\n * @example\n * // ES2015\n * import React from 'react'\n * import Dimensions from 'react-dimensions'\n *\n * class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n *   render() (\n *     <div\n *       containerWidth={this.props.containerWidth}\n *
